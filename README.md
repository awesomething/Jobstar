<h3> How Does Jobstar Work?</h3>
<p> STEP 1 - Use non-traditional methods - like a dress rehearsal - where the final applicants work remotely to create a website clone..</p>
<p> STEP 2 - Fast-track your hiring process and onboard people based on proof of work. Devs would ship small features and fix bugs frequently, while communicating with you on video call.</p>
<p>STEP 3 - You get to decide at an interview for fulltime offer or longterm contract. They might not be ready for the fulltime job just yet, until they have engaged in a contract job with you.</p>

<h3>Technology Stack Used</h3> 
<p>React, NodeJs & PostgreSql</p>
